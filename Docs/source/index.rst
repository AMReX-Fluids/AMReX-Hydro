Welcome to AMReX-Hydro's Documentation
======================================

AMReX-Hydro is set of routines that support the construction of convective
terms for incompressible and low Mach number flow modeling.
It supports Cartesian coordinates with (or without) embedded boundaries and R-Z coordinate systems.
It's freely available
on GitHub: https://github.com/AMReX-Fluids/AMReX-Hydro .

AMReX-Hydro is built on top of AMReX: https://github.com/AMReX-Codes/amrex ,
a publicly available software framework designed for
building massively parallel block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
applications.
